# Job-Finder-Python-Project
 I created a Python Job Finder project using web scraping for job listings, allowing users to apply, save, and remove jobs. The platform includes profile creation, offering personalized job suggestions based on resumes, along with basic interview questions and videos.Web designing is done using FLASK.
